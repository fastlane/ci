# https://help.github.com/articles/about-codeowners/
# The order is relevant, most important rule at the bottom
# It is important that every team has write access to the repo
# that's why all ci-related teams are a child team of `@fastlane/Team`
# so they automatically get write access to this repo
# If you introduce a new team, make sure they are also a child-team of
# `@fastlane/Team`

# We don't need a default owner, as it will automatically fallback to
# requiring at least one review

# Multiple owners
