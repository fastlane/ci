module FastlaneCI
  # Class that represents a BuildRunner, used
  # to run tests for a given commit sha
  #
  # Responsible for
  # - Run the build (e.g. fastlane via FastlaneBuildRunner) and check its return status
  # - Raise an exception if build fails, with information that can be handled by `TestRunnerService`
  # - Reporting back a list of artifacts  to `TestRunnerService`
  # - Measures the time of a `TestRunner`'s execution
  # - Stores the `Build` information in version control and triggers the report of the build status on GitHub
  # - Offer a way to subscribe to new lines being added to the output (e.g. to stream them to the user's browser)
