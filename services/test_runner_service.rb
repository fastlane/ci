module FastlaneCI
  # Responsible for the life cycle of running tests as part of fastlane.ci
  # In particular this takes care of all the overhead, like measuring the time and storing & reporting
  # the build status
  # - TestRunnerService owns a TestRunner
  # - TestRunnerService is alive until it's finished running
  # - TestRunnerService is created on the fly, either when "resuming" a build, or when a new build is triggered by a project trigger
  # - TestRunner only runs tests. Stays alive as long as the TestRunnerService
